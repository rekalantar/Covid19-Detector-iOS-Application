This project was supervised by Professor Mu-Dow Koh, Dr Christina Messiou, Dr Matthew Blackledge and Dr Jessica Winfield and it was undertaken in colaboration with Professor Giovanni Morana and Dr Nicholas Landini at the Radiology Institute, Treviso University Hospital, Italy. To train the model, publicly-available and anonymised frontal chest X-ray scans of patients were used. The app also enables users to upload scans to database. All texts on patient scans are automatically blocked before uploading to database."
